[.lead]
_Emerald Dshackle is a Fault Tolerant Load Balancer for Blockchain API._

Dshackle provides a high level aggregated API on top of several underlying upstreams.
I.e. on top of blockchain nodes such as Bitcoind, Geth, Parity, or providers like Infura, and so on.
It automatically verifies their availability and the current status of the network, executes commands making sure that the response is consistent and/or data successfully broadcasted to the network.

- Standard Bitcoin and Ethereum JSON RPC API, plus enhanced gRPC-based API
- **Secure** TLS with optional client authentication
- Blockchain-aware **caching** in memory and in Redis
- Routing based on **data availability** (peers, height, sync status)
- **Data consistency**, always gives the most actual state
- Automatic **failover** and retry
- Separate public blockchain nodes from your internal servers

Dshackle allows to build a mesh network of interconnected Dshackle servers for building blockchain based services that needs to have fast, secure, stable and fail-proof access to blockchain APIs.

Blockchain support:

- Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Kovan testnet
- Bitcoin and Bitcoin Testnet

WARNING: The project is still under development, please use with caution.

Dshackle connects to several upstreams via JSON RPC, Websockets, or gRPC protocol.
The server verifies if a node ("upstream") is fully synchronized (not in initial sync mode), has enough peers, and its height is not behind other nodes.
If upstream lags behind others, lost peers below required, started to resync or went down, then Dshackle temporarily excludes it from requests and returns it when the upstream problem is fixed.

== Roadmap

- [ ] External logging
- [ ] Prometheus monitoring
- [ ] Subscription to bitcoind notification over gRPC (instead of ZeroMQ)
- [ ] BIP-32 Pubkey
- [ ] Lightweight sidecar node connector
- [ ] Configurable upstream roles

== Quick Start

=== Configuration

Create file `dshackle.yaml` with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
version: v1
port: 2449
tls:
  enabled: false

proxy:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8545
  routes:
    - id: eth
      blockchain: ethereum
    - id: btc
      blockchain: bitcoin

cluster:
  upstreams:
    - id: infura-eth
      chain: ethereum
      connection:
        ethereum:
          rpc:
            url: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_USER}"
          ws:
            url: "wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/${INFURA_USER}"
    - id: bitcoin-main
      chain: bitcoin
      connection:
        bitcoin:
          rpc:
            url: "http://localhost:8332"
            basic-auth:
              username: bitcoin
              password: mypassword
----

Which sets the following:

- gRPC access through 0.0.0.0:2449
** TLS security is disabled (_please don't use in production!_)
- JSON RPC access through 0.0.0.0:8545
** proxy requests to Ethereum and Kovan upstreams
** request path for Ethereum Mainnet is `/eth`, for bitcoin is `/btc`
** i.e. call Ethereum Mainnet by `POST http://127.0.0.0:8545/eth` with JSON RPC payload
- two upstreams, one for Ethereum Mainnet and another for Kovan Testnet (both upstreams are configured to use Infura endpoint)
- for Ethereum Mainnet it connects using JSON RPC and Websockets connections,
- for Bitcoin Mainet only JSON RPC is used
- `${INFURA_USER}` will be provided through environment variable

Please note that you can configure many upstreams for a single blockchains.
If there is more that one upstream, then Dshackle makes requests to them with Round Robin Load Balancing.
If one of them goes down, Dshackle continues to use only active nodes.

I.e. you can set up a node in the local network, and the Infura, and if anything happened to you local node, you'll still be able to have access to a consistent state of the Ethereum blockchain.


link:docs[See full documentations].

==== Run docker image

Official Docker image you can find at: https://hub.docker.com/r/emeraldpay/dshackle[emeraldpay/dshackle]

.Setup Infura username
[source,bash]
----
export INFURA_USER=...
----

.Run Dshackle
[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 2449:2449 -p 8545:8545 -v $(pwd):/etc/dshackle -e "INFURA_USER=$INFURA_USER" emeraldpay/dshackle
----

Now it listen on port 2449 at the localhost and can be connected from any gRPC compatible client.
Tools such as https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[gRPCurl] can automatically parse protobuf definitions and connect to it (actual Protobuf sources are located in a separate repository which you can find at https://github.com/emeraldpay/proto)

Alternatively you can connect to port 8545 with traditional JSON RPC requests

==== Access using JSON RPC

Dshackle implements standard JSON RPC interface, providing additional caching layer, upstream readiness/liveness checks, retry and other features for building Fault Tolerant services.

.Request using Curl
[source,bash]
----
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8545/eth \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_getBalance", "id":1, "params":["0x690b2bdf41f33f9f251ae0459e5898b856ed96be", "latest"]}'
----

.Output
[source,bash]
----
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x72fa5e0181"}
----

==== Access using gRPC

NOTE: It's not necessary to use gRPC, as Dshackle can provide standard JSON RPC proxy, but Dshackle gRPC interface improves performance and provides additional features.

Dshackle provides a custom gRPC based API, which provides additional methods and other features such as streaming responses.
Please refer to the documentation: link:docs/06-methods.adoc[gRPC Methods]

.Connect and listen for new blocks on Ethereum Mainnet
[source,bash]
----
grpcurl -import-path ./proto/ -proto blockchain.proto -d '{\"type\": 100}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:2449 emerald.Blockchain/SubscribeHead
----

`type: 100` specifies the blockchain id, and 100 means Ethereum Mainnet. `1` is for Bitcoin Mainnet.
There we use Ethereum because it creates new blocks every 14 seconds, which works better for demo purposes, but the same request applied to Bitcoin as well.

.Output would be like
----
{
  "chain": "CHAIN_ETHEREUM",
  "height": 8396159,
  "blockId": "fc58a258adccc94466ae967b1178eea721349b0667f59d5fe1b0b436460bce75",
  "timestamp": 1566423564000,
  "weight": "AnMcf2VJB5kOSQ=="
}
{
  "chain": "CHAIN_ETHEREUM",
  "height": 8396160,
  "blockId": "787899711b862b77df8d2faa69de664048598265a9f96abf178d341076e200e0",
  "timestamp": 1566423574000,
  "weight": "AnMch35tO6hSGg=="
}
...
...
----

The output above is for a _streaming subscription_ to all new blocks on the Ethereum Mainnet.

It's one of the services provided by Dshackle, in addition to standard methods provided by RPC JSON of underlying nodes.

.You can also subscribe to balances changes of the balance on an address:
[source,bash]
----
grpcurl -import-path ./proto/ -proto blockchain.proto -d '{\"asset\": {\"chain\": \"100\", \"code\": \"ether\"}, \"address\": {\"address_single\": {\"address\": \"0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2\"}}}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:2449 emerald.Blockchain/SubscribeBalance
----

.and see how balance of the contract responsible for Wrapped Ether is changing:
----
{
  "asset": {
    "chain": "CHAIN_ETHEREUM",
    "code": "ETHER"
  },
  "address": {
    "address": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2"
  },
  "balance": "2410941696896999943701015"
}
{
  "asset": {
    "chain": "CHAIN_ETHEREUM",
    "code": "ETHER"
  },
  "address": {
    "address": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2"
  },
  "balance": "2410930748488073834320430"
}
...
----

The balance subscription works with main coin (_ether_, _bticoin_), or with tokens like ERC-20 if configured additionally.
