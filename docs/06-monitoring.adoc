= Logging & Monitoring

Dshackle can log all requests to a file in JSON format.
Or https://jsonlines.org/[JSON Lines] to be more precise, i.e., a test file where each line is a JSON.

It includes:

- _Access Log_ - requests made to Dshackle from a client
- _Request Log_ - requests made by Dshackle to an upstream

Because some requests may produce multiple responses, or multiple internal requests the log is not related as one-to-one.
But instead maintains a reference a `request.id` in both logs, that can be used to join multiple access and request logs into a single trace.

== Access Log

NOTE: By default, the Access log is disabled.

To enable access log add following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
access-log:
  enabled: true
  filename: /var/log/dshackle/access_log.jsonl
----

`filename` is optional, and the default value is `access_log.jsonl` (i.e., in the current directory).

Or if you use a centralized log processor listening a socket:

[source,yaml]
----
access-log:
  enabled: true
  type: socket
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 9000
----

In this case all logs sent to the `127.0.0.1:9000` socket via TCP, and each line is prefixed with a 32 bit length.

Since a single request may contain multiple replies (ex., a batch call, or subscribe to the head blocks) the Dshackle logging is based on replies.
The access log file contains details per each response send from the server, and each of them refers to original request details.

The log contains the JSON lines similar to:

[source,json]
----
{
  "version":"accesslog/v1beta2",
  "id":"578d83db-cf53-4ef8-b73e-3f1cc0a67e96",
  "channel":"DSHACKLE",
  "ts":"2021-07-20T01:53:33.174645Z",
  "method":"NativeCall",
  "blockchain":"ETHEREUM",
  "total":2,
  "index":0,
  "succeed":true,
  "request":{
    "id":"513b9b49-b472-4c83-b4b7-58dd2aabe9f6",
    "start":"2021-07-20T01:53:33.086946Z",
    "remote":{
      "ips":["127.0.0.1", "10.0.5.102", "172.217.8.78"],
      "ip":"172.217.8.78",
      "userAgent":"grpc-node-js/1.1.8"
    }
  },
  "nativeCall":{
     "method":"eth_blockNumber",
     "id":2,
     "payloadSizeBytes":2
  }
}
----

.Where:
- `version` version of the JSON format (note it may change until `v1`, i.e., a version with `alpha`, `beta`, etc., is not a final format)
- `id` uniq id of the reply
- `channel` access channel (`DSHACKLE` for native Dshackle calls, `JSONRPC` for JSON RPC HTTP Proxy)
- `ts` timestamp of the reply
- `method` Dshackle method which was called (i.e., not a Blockchain API method, see `nativeCall` details)
- `blockchain` blockchain code
- `total` how many requests in the batch (available only for a `NativeCall` call)
- `index` current index (i.e. count) of the reply to the original request
- `succeed` if call succeeded, in terms of Blockchain API
- `request` original request details
** `id` uniq id of the request; all replied to the same request have same id
** `start` when request was received
** `remote` remote details
*** `ips` list of all recognized IPs (including headers such as `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For`)
*** `ip` a single ip, that likely represent a real IP of the remote
*** `userAgent` user agent
- `nativeCall` details of the individual Native Call request
** `method` method name terms of Blockchain API
** `id` request id provided in the original request
** `payloadSizeBytes` size of the original _individual_ request (for JSON RPC it's size of the `params` value)

== Request Log

NOTE: By default, the request log is disabled.

To enable request log add following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
request-log:
  enabled: true
  filename: /var/log/dshackle/request_log.jsonl
----

Could use the same config as Access Log for sockets:

[source,yaml]
----
request-log:
  enabled: true
  type: socket
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 9000
----

The log contains the JSON lines similar to:

[source,json]
----
{
  "version":"requestlog/v1alpha",
  "id":"c23a5391-1b8c-40b0-a32f-fa736b8175a2",
  "success":true,
  "upstream":{
    "id":"sepolia",
    "channel":"WSJSONRPC",
    "type":"JSONRPC"
  },
  "request":{
    "source":"INTERNAL",
    "id":"f2ae5096-b7d0-4006-99c5-0108bd295df4",
    "start":"2022-11-09T01:13:25.652663Z"
  },
  "jsonrpc":{
    "method":"eth_getBlockByHash",
    "id":218
  },
  "blockchain":"TESTNET_SEPOLIA",
  "execute":"2022-11-09T01:13:25.540592Z",
  "complete":"2022-11-09T01:13:25.652683Z",
  "responseSize":6243,
  "queueTime":0,
  "requestTime":112
}
----

.Where:
- `version` version of the JSON format (note it may change until `v1`, i.e., a version with `alpha`, `beta`, etc., is not a final format)
- `id` uniq id of the request
- `success` if it returns a result or an error
- `upstream` upstream reference
** `id` id as defined in upstreams config
** `channel` type of the connection (`WSJSONRPC` for a Websocket JSON RPC, `JSONRPC` for HTTP JSON RPC, `DSHACKLE` for Dshackle protocol)
** `type` type of the request (`DSHACKLE` for Dshackle gRPC request, `JSONRPC` as JSON RPC, and `WSSUBSCRIBE` Websocket subscription request)
- `request` reference to original request
** `source` is `REQUEST` when is caused by external call, or `INTERNAL` if it's an internal request such as a health check
** `id` for a `REQUEST` source it's the same id as in access log in `request.id` field.
For an `INTERNAL` source it's just an internal id.
** `start` time when the request was initiated (note that the execution time may differ, see below)
- `jsonrpc` details about the JSON RPC request (optional)
- `blockchain` blockchain associated with the request (optional)
- `execute` time when the request started to execute.
Some request may consist of multiple additional requests, or a request may wait until other requests are returned.
So it may be after the `request.start` time.
- `complete` time when the response was received from upstream.
- `responseSize` response payload size in bytes (payload here means it's not the whole json but only the _result_ part).
- `queueTime` - the time between _start_ and _execute_ moments, in milliseconds
- `requestTime` - the time between _execute_ and _complete_ moments, in milliseconds

== Prometheus Metrics

By default, Dshackle provides Prometheus metrics on `http://127.0.0.1:8081/metrics`.

To configure the metrics use:

[source,yaml]
----
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  jvm: false
  extended: false
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
    bind: 192.168.0.1
    port: 8000
    path: /status/prometheus
----

Where `jvm` options enabled monitoring of the JVM internals, such as memory, GC, threads, etc.
And `extended` enables additional metrics for query selectors, etc.

== Grafana Dashboard

Simple Grafana dashboard available link:../dashboard/dshackle.json[here]

image::dshackle-dashboard.png[alt="",width=80%,align="center"]

This dashboard contains:

- Upstreams Availability

- Upstreams Lag

- JSON RPC total request / failed requests

- GRPC total request / failed requests

- JSON RPC Response time

- Upstreams Errors

- JSON RPC upstream conn seconds 50,75,90,99 percentiles

== Health Checks

Dshackle provides a http endpoint to check status of the servers.
This check is compatible with https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#http-probes[Kubernetes Liveness and Readiness Probes].

By default, it's disabled, and you have to set up which blockchain are required to be available to consider Dshackle alive.

.Example config:
[source,yaml]
----
health:
  port: 8082 # <1>
  host: 127.0.0.1 # <2>
  path: /health # <3>
  blockchains: # <4>
    - chain: ethereum # <5>
      min-available: 2 # <6>
    - chain: bitcoin
      min-available: 1
----

<1> (optional) port to bind the Health server.
Default: `8082`
<2> (optional) host to bind the Health server.
Default: `127.0.0.1`
<3> (optional) path on the server.
Default: `/health`.
I.e., `http://127.0.0.1:8082/health` with default config
<4> list of blockchain to check availability
<5> a Blockchain to check
<6> minimum available (i.e., fully synced) Upstreams for that blockchain

With the config above the server is considered healthy if:

- Dshackle has connected to at least two valid Ethereum upstreams
- **and** at least one valid Bitcoin upstream.

When the server is healthy is responds with `OK` and 200 as HTTP Status Code.
When any of the checks failed, it responds with a short description and 503 as HTTP Status Code.

Example of a response for an unhealthy server that doesn't have enough upstreams for a Ethereum Classic Blockchain.

.GET http://127.0.0.1:8082/health
----
ETHEREUM_CLASSIC UNAVAILABLE
----

Optionally, the server can be called with `?detailed` query, which provides a more detailed response:

.GET http://127.0.0.1:8082/health?detailed
----
ETHEREUM_CLASSIC UNAVAILABLE
BITCOIN AVAILABLE
  local-btc-1 OK with lag=0
ETHEREUM AVAILABLE
  local-eth-1 OK with lag=0
  local-eth-2 OK with lag=0
----
