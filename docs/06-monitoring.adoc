= Logging & Monitoring

== Access / Request Log

Dshackle can log all requests to a file in JSON format.
Or https://jsonlines.org/[JSON Lines] to be more precise, i.e., a test file where each line is a JSON.

NOTE: By default, the access log is disabled.

To enable access log add following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
accessLog:
  enabled: true
  filename: /var/log/dshackle/access_log.jsonl
----

`filename` is optional, and the default value is `access_log.jsonl` (i.e., in the current directory).

Since a single request may contain multiple replies (ex., a batch call, or subscribe to the head blocks) the Dshackle logging is based on replies.
The access log file contains details per each response send from the server, and each of them refers to original request details.

The access log contains the JSON lines similar to:

[source,json]
----
{
  "version":"accesslog/v1beta",
  "ts":"2021-07-20T01:53:33.174645Z",
  "id":"578d83db-cf53-4ef8-b73e-3f1cc0a67e96",
  "method":"NativeCall",
  "blockchain":"ETHEREUM",
  "total":2,
  "index":0,
  "succeed":true,
  "request":{
    "id":"513b9b49-b472-4c83-b4b7-58dd2aabe9f6",
    "start":"2021-07-20T01:53:33.086946Z",
    "remote":{
      "ips":["127.0.0.1", "10.0.5.102", "172.217.8.78"],
      "ip":"172.217.8.78",
      "userAgent":"grpc-node-js/1.1.8"
    }
  },
  "nativeCall":{
     "method":"eth_blockNumber",
     "id":2,
     "payloadSizeBytes":2
  }
}
----

.Where:
- `ts` timestamp of the reply
- `id` uniq id of the reply
- `method` Dshackle method which was called (i.e., not a Blockchain API method, see `nativeCall` details)
- `blockchain` blockchain code
- `total` how many requests in the batch (available only for a `NativeCall` call)
- `index` current index (i.e. count) of the reply to the original request
- `succeed` if call succeeded, in terms of Blockchain API
- `request` original request details
** `id` uniq id of the request; all replied to the same request have same id
** `start` when request was received
** `remote` remote details
*** `ips` list of all recognized IPs (including headers such as `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For`)
*** `ip` a single ip, that likely represent a real IP of the remote
*** `userAgent` user agent
- `nativeCall` details of the individual Native Call request
** `method` method name terms of Blockchain API
** `id` request id provided in the original request
** `payloadSizeBytes` size of the original _individual_ request (for JSON RPC it's size of the `params` value)

== Prometheus Metrics

By default, Dshackle provides Prometheus metrics on `http://127.0.0.1:8081/metrics`.

To configure the metrics use:

[source,yaml]
----
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  jvm: false
  extended: false
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
    bind: 192.168.0.1
    port: 8000
    path: /status/prometheus
----

Where `jvm` options enabled monitoring of the JVM internals, such as memory, GC, threads, etc.
And `extended` enables additional metrics for query selectors, etc.
