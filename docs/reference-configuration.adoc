.Main Config
[cols="2a,1a,5"]
|===
| Option | Required | Description

| yes
| Per-cluster identifier of an upstream

| `blockchain`
| yes
| Blockchain which is the provided by the upstream.
Cluster may have multiple upstreams for a single blockchain.
Accepted types: `bitcoin`, `bitcoin-testnet`, `ethereum`, `ethereum-classic`, or `sepolia-testnet`


| `labels`
| no
| Key-Value pairs that are assigned to the upstream.
Used to select an upstream per-request.
See link:09-quorum-and-selectors.adoc[Quorum and Selectors]

|
|
| + Additional options, see <<general-options>>

| `methods`
| no
| Enable (`enabled`) or disable (`disabled`) additional JSON RPC methods that are provided by that particular upstream

| yes
| Name of the RPC method to enable/disable.

`always` (default) - accept any response;
`not_empty` - accept not _null_ value, otherwise retry another upstream;
`not_lagging` - accept response only from a fully synced upstream.

[#general-options]
=== Additional Options

[cols="2a,1,1a,5"]
|===
| Option | Type | Default | Description


| `enabled`
| boolean
| `true`
| Enable/disable the upstream.

| `role`
| enum
| `primary`
| `primary`, `secondary` or `fallback`.
First it makes the requests to the upstreams with role `primary`, then if none are available to upstreams with role `secondary`.
Fallback role mean that the upstream is used only after other upstreams failed or didn't return quorum

| `priority`
| number
| 10
| Upstream priority used to resolve Fork Conflicts between different upstreams when a Proof-of-Stake blockchain is used.
When two upstreams has different blocks at the same height then the value from Upstreams with higher `priority` value wins.
Configuration has no effect in Proof-of-Work blockchains.

| `disable-validation`
| boolean
| `false`
| Disables all the validations of the upstream. I.e., it turns off `validate-peers` and `validate-syncing` checks if set to `true`.

| `validation-interval`
| number
| `30`
| Period in seconds to re-validate the upstream.

| `validate-peers`
| boolean
| `true`
| Disables validation of the peers connected to the upstream (as `net_peerCount` method).
Dshackle assumes that if there are too few peers then the Upstream is just started and may produce invalid/outdated responses

| `min-peers`
| number
| `1`
| The minimum number of connected peer to consider the upstream valid if `validate-peers` is enabled.
If it's set to `0` it essentially disables the peer validation.

| `validate-syncing`
| boolean
| `true`
| Disables checking for the state of syncing on the upstream (as `eth_syncing` method).
If the Upstream is in _syncing_ state then the Dshackle doesn't use it for call until it reaches the blockchain head.

| `timeout`
| number
| `60`
| Timeout in seconds to wait for an answer from the upstream before considering it as failed.

| `balance`
| boolean
|
| Suitable for Bitcoin upstream.
Tells if the Upstream can be used to call balance methods, which requires that the node has the indexing as turned on.

[#upstream-dshackle]
=== Dshackle Upstream

Another option is using another Dshackle server as an upstream.
It's more effective, easier to secure connection, and allows to build a distributed network of servers.
